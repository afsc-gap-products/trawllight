# trawllight
The trawllight R package contains functions to implement an algorithm that derives apparent optical properties from light measurements collected during NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center bottom-trawl surveys using trawl-mounted archival tags. A description of the light data collection protocol, algorithm subroutines, and algorithm performance is provided in Rohan et al. (2020) and Rohan et al. (2021).

<i>Transect along 60Â°N on the eastern Bering Sea shelf in 2017 showing the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>(<i>z, tag</i>), mixed layer depth (MLD), bottom layer depth (BLD), and depth where downwelling irradiance is equal to 10% of irradiance and just beneath the sea surface (Z<sub>10%</sub>, i.e., optical depth = 2.3).

Average mixed layer depth and Z<sub>10%</sub> on the eastern Bering Sea continental shelf during summers (late May-early August) 2004 to 2017.

Near-bottom optical depth (i.e., optical depth ~2.5 m above the seafloor) in the eastern Bering Sea during summers 2004 to 2017. Increments of 2.303 correspond with an order of magnitude difference in downwelling irradiance.


# Installation

trawllight can be installed by starting R and running the following code. Installation requires the devtools package.
