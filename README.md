# trawllight
The trawllight R package contains functions to implement an algorithm that derives apparent optical properties from light (downwelling irradiance) measurements collected during NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center bottom-trawl surveys using trawl-mounted archival tags. The light data collection protocol, algorithm subroutines, and algorithm performance are described in Rohan et al. (2020) and Rohan et al. (2021).

<i>Transect along 60Â°N on the eastern Bering Sea shelf in 2017 showing the downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>(<i>z, tag</i>), mixed layer depth (MLD), bottom layer depth (BLD), and depth where downwelling irradiance is equal to 10% of irradiance and just beneath the sea surface (Z<sub>10%</sub>, i.e., optical depth = 2.3).</i>


# Installation
