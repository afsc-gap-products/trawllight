# trawllight
The trawllight R package contains functions to implement an algorithm that derives apparent optical properties from light measurements collected during NOAA bottom-trawl surveys. A description of the light data collection protocol, algorithm subroutines, and algorithm performance is presented in Rohan et al. (in prep). Algorithm subroutines are contained in individual functions in the trawllight package.

The most recent version of the trawllight package was built in R 3.6.2.


# Installation

trawllight can be installed by starting R and running the following code. Installation requires the devtools package.

```
require(devtools)
install_github("sean-rohan/trawllight")
```

# Vignette

A vignette demonstrating how to use the trawllight package is in development (SR Jan 24, 2020).
